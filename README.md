# sending_messages_telegram
What does a bot do and how does it work?
The bot sends messages to all users in the group, you just enter the NAME of the group, and the message you want to write to people, the first time you use it, you need to enter the telegram phone number and confirm it with a code, after which a session will be created and the phone number will no longer be requested

We have 2 main files start.py and sending_script.py, the first one launches your telegram bot, and with it you can send out, or run the second one in the terminal and do the same

Before starting, you need to install 2 libraries
`pip install aiogram`
`pip install telethon`
